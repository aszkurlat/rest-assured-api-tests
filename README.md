# REST-Assured API Tests

This repository contains example API tests implemented using **REST-Assured** in **Java**.

The tests demonstrate basic functionality for testing RESTful APIs, including:

- Sending requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Validating responses (status codes, headers, body)
- Handling JSON payloads

These examples are intended as a starting point and will be expanded over time as more test cases and scenarios are added.

> Note: This is a work-in-progress repository. The focus is on practicing API testing and building a collection of automated tests with REST-Assured.
